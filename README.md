# Mouse2Controller

Python script who map mouse direction to keyboard arrows
the right, middle and left click are also map to keyboard button
and the key "esc" exit the script.

I made this script to play Super Mario World on Emulator with a Mouse, just for fun.

Need to install python and the library pynput

for install pynput you need pip and install with pip like "pip install pynput"

to view my first playtest, check my youtube channel

this script is not out of bug. one time the game lag because of the script, I need to stop and restart the script
I play with a 1920x1080 screen, bigger screen work but the cursor still remain in the 1920x1080 area. Adapt the code for your screen if not 1920x1080.
