# Mouse2Controller

Python script who map mouse direction to keyboard arrows
the right, middle and left click are also map to keyboard button
and the key "esc" exit the script.

I made this script to play Super Mario World on Emulator with a Mouse, just for fun.

Need to install python and the library pynput

for install pynput you need pip and install with pip like "pip install pynput"
